# Broker API Project (for want of a better name)

## Getting started

Most application interaction can be done using the Makefile, including running the API, testing and linting.
Once running, automatically generated API documentation is available at localhost:port/redoc.

## Contributing

Changes will not be merged unless they pass are linted and tested.
